The CAP theorem is a concept in distributed computing that states that it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:

| Guarantee | Description |
| - | - |
| Consistency | Consistency refers to the guarantee that all nodes in a distributed system see the same data at the same time.  |
| Availability | Availability refers to the guarantee that a distributed system will always be available and responsive to user requests. |
| Partition Tolerance | Partition tolerance refers to the guarantee that a distributed system will continue to function even if network partitions occur, meaning that communication between nodes is temporarily lost. |

The CAP theorem suggests that in any distributed system, you must choose which two of the three guarantees to prioritize, as it is impossible to achieve all three simultaneously. There are several storage solutions available for distributed systems, and each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to the guarantees provided by the CAP theorem. Here are a few examples:

## Relational Databases

Relational databases: Relational databases are designed for consistency and partition tolerance. They ensure that all nodes in a distributed system see the same data at the same time and can handle network partitions. However, achieving high availability can be challenging in a distributed relational database, as it requires replicating data across multiple nodes.

## Key-value Stores

Key-value stores: Key-value stores are designed for high availability and partition tolerance. They are often used in distributed caching systems and can provide fast, low-latency access to data. However, key-value stores sacrifice consistency, as they allow data to be out of sync across nodes for short periods of time.

## Document Databases

Document databases: Document databases are designed for partition tolerance and availability. They can handle network partitions and are often used in systems where data needs to be highly available. However, achieving consistency can be challenging, as document databases may not provide strong consistency guarantees across all nodes.

## Distributed File Systems

Distributed file systems: Distributed file systems are designed for partition tolerance and availability. They can handle network partitions and provide fast access to large amounts of data. However, achieving consistency can be challenging, as distributed file systems may not provide strong consistency guarantees across all nodes.
