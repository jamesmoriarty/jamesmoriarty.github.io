## Personal Philosophy

Here are some quotes that epitomize my personal philosophy.

> "The way to know life is to love many things."\
_―Vincent Van Gogh_

<hr />

> "Climb mountains not so the world can see you, but so you can see the world."
_―David McCullough Jr_

<hr />

> "Erase the false impressions from your mind by constantly saying to yourself, I have it my soul to keep out any evil, desire, or any kind of disturbance - instead, seeing the true nature of things, I will give them only their due. Always remember this power that nature gave you"
_―Marcus Aurelius_
